# roman-numeral-calculator
A small roman numeral calculator written in python that supports three operations [+, -, x] and shows the work for each step of the calculation.

I wrote this script to verify one of my homework assignments in a CS class. It purely deals in roman numerals and arrives at the correct answer based on roman numeral relationship pairs (subtractives and grouping). It does not support division because roman numerals only work in integer context. 


## Installation

1. Download the script.
2. Run `$ python romanNumeralCalculator.py` and read the directions that are displayed.
