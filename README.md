# roman-numeral-calculator
A roman numeral calculator written in python that supports three operations [+, -, x] and shows the work for each step of the calculation.

This is a small roman numeral caclulator that supports 3 operations [+, -, x]. It does not support division because roman numerals only work in integer context. I wrote this script to verify one of my homework assignments in a CS class.


## Installation

1. Download the script.
2. Run `$ python romanNumeralCalculator.py` and read the directions that are displayed.


## Important!

+ Do not copy this code.


## To Do

+ Testing
+ Make sure the second value passed when subtracting is less than the first passed value - roman numerals do not support negative numbers.
